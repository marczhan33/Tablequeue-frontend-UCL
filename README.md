# TableQueue Frontend (UCL MSc Computer Science Application)

This repository contains the **frontend code** for [TableQueue](https://tablequeue.uk), a real-time restaurant waitlist management application.

Developed independently as part of my journey transitioning into Computer Science and submitted in support of my application to the MSc Computer Science program at UCL.

##  Whatâ€™s Included in This Repo

This repository includes **only the frontend code** (`client/src/`) for the application.
The backend and business logic have been excluded to preserve proprietary development and data structures.
